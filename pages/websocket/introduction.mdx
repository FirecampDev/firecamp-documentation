## WebSocket Playground

The WebSocket Playground in Firecamp provides a powerful environment for real-time communication with WebSocket-based APIs. With its intuitive interface and comprehensive features, the WebSocket Playground allows you to interact with WebSocket endpoints, send and receive messages, and explore the full potential of real-time data exchange.

### Key Features
1. **Connect WebSocket Endpoints:** The WebSocket Playground allows you to establish connections with WebSocket endpoints effortlessly. Simply provide the endpoint URL, and Firecamp handles the connection setup for you.

2. **Message Exchange:** With the WebSocket Playground, you can send and receive WebSocket messages in real-time. This feature enables you to simulate real-world scenarios, test the behavior of your WebSocket API, and observe the response messages.

3. **Event Logs:** The WebSocket Playground offers detailed event logs that capture the WebSocket connection status, incoming and outgoing messages, and any encountered errors. These logs assist in monitoring and troubleshooting WebSocket interactions effectively.

4. **Event Log Preview:** Firecamp provides a convenient event log preview feature, allowing you to quickly glance at the recent WebSocket events without switching between tabs. This helps you stay updated on the WebSocket activity while focusing on your message exchange.

5. **Close Connection with Reason:** You can gracefully close WebSocket connections with a specific reason using the WebSocket Playground. This feature ensures proper termination of the connection and enables you to handle connection closure scenarios in your application.

6. **Custom Headers and Params:** Firecamp allows you to manage and customize the headers and parameters for your WebSocket requests. You can add authentication tokens, authorization details, or any additional information required by your WebSocket server.

7. **Message Collection:** The WebSocket Playground includes a message collection feature, which allows you to store and organize WebSocket messages for reference and analysis. This feature is particularly useful for tracking and reviewing message history during development and debugging.

8. **Collaboration:** Firecamp fosters collaboration by providing the ability to share and collaborate on WebSocket collection. You can work together with team members, share WebSocket collection, and collaborate on real-time communication scenarios.

With the WebSocket Playground in Firecamp, you can easily connect to WebSocket endpoints, exchange messages, and leverage advanced features for efficient WebSocket development and testing.
