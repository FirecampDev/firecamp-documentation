## Message Collection
The Message Collection feature in the WebSocket Playground provides a powerful way to manage and organize WebSocket messages. It allows you to save, retrieve, and collaborate on messages exchanged during your WebSocket interactions.
Following are the key features of Message Collection

#### Save Messages
With the Message Collection, you can save WebSocket messages at the root level or within specific folders. This feature enables you to categorize and organize your messages for easy access and reference.

#### Open Saved Messages
You can open any saved message from the Message Collection directly in the WebSocket Playground. This allows you to resend the message over the WebSocket connection, facilitating quick testing and interaction with your WebSocket API.

#### Delete Messages
The Message Collection allows you to delete unwanted or outdated messages. This helps you maintain a clean and relevant collection, ensuring that only necessary messages are stored for future use.

#### Request Documentation
The Message Collection automatically generates documentation for your WebSocket requests. This documentation provides a summary of the message, including the request URL, headers, and payload. It serves as a useful reference for documenting your WebSocket interactions.
