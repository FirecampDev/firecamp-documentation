# API Collection

## Overview

In Firecamp, a collection refers to a set of saved API requests organized in a structured manner. Collections provide a convenient way to store and manage your frequently used requests, making it easier to reuse, share, and collaborate on API workflows. Within a workspace, collections can be accessed and utilized by all members, enhancing collaboration and productivity.

### Sharing a Collection

#### Sharing Within the Workspace
When you create a collection within a workspace, all members of that workspace can access and work with the collection by default. This allows for efficient teamwork and knowledge sharing, as everyone within the workspace can leverage the saved requests and benefit from the collective effort.

#### Sharing Outside of the Workspace
If you need to share a collection with someone outside of the workspace, Firecamp provides an easy way to do so. You can export the collection and share the exported file with the intended recipient. They can then import the collection into their Firecamp instance, making it accessible to them.

##### Export the Collection
To export a collection, follow these steps:

1. Open the collection menu you want to share.
2. Click on the "Export" button.
3. Save the exported file to your local system.
