## Overview
Tests scripts will allow you to write certain test assertions for request. The syntax of test scripts would be like **`fc.tests('test title', testFunction)`**.
The first argument of tests function will be the **title** of the test and second argument will be the **assertion function**. 

#### use of tests snippets

You can write the test to check the status code 200 like this
```ts
fc.test("Status code is 200", ()=> {
    fc.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```
<Callout type="info">
  pre built **response** assertions are used from `fc.response.(to|have)`, you can learn more from here.
</Callout>

```ts
fc.test("Successful POST request", ()=> {
    fc.expect(fc.response.code).to.be.oneOf([201, 202]);
});
```
<Callout type="info">
  **fc.expect** is same as Chai.expect.
