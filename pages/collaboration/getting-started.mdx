## Getting Started
Firecamp team collaboration allows you to seamlessly collaborate with your team members, ensuring efficient communication, shared resources, and streamlined workflows.

Prerequisites
Before you dive into team collaboration using Firecamp, there are a few prerequisites you need to fullfil. These prerequisites will ensure that you have a smooth experience and make the most of Firecamp's collaboration features.

To Achieve Maximum Collaboration, You Need to Have the Following Prerequisites

 **1. Firecamp Account:** Each team member should have their own Firecamp account. If they don't have one, they can easily sign up on the Firecamp web.

 **2. Access to Firecamp:** Ensure that you and your team members have access to the Firecamp application. This can be through the web version or the desktop application (soon to be released), depending on your preferences.

### Organization 
In Firecamp, an Organization is a container that holds all your workspaces and projects. Organizations allow you to manage different teams and projects efficiently. You can think of an Organization as the top-level grouping for your work.

### Workspace 
Within an Organization, we have the concept of a Workspace. A Workspace is a place where you collaborate on specific projects, APIs, and collections. It's a focused environment where your team can work together. Each Workspace has its own set of resources, making it easier to organize and manage your projects.

### Invite members
Collaboration wouldn't be complete without your team members. Firecamp makes it easy to invite team members to your Organization and specific Workspaces.
