## Firecamp Agents

Firecamp Agents provide different execution environments for your API requests within Firecamp. There are three types of Firecamp Agents:

#### 1. Browser Agent
When using the Browser Agent, requests are executed from the browser environment. However, there may be limitations due to CORS errors.

#### 2. Cloud Agent
The Cloud Agent allows requests to be executed from Firecamp's secure cloud infrastructure. However, keep in mind that there are limitations, such as the inability to connect to your localhost server from the cloud server.

#### 3. Browser Extension Agent
> **Extension Agent is under development, will be releasing soon.**

By installing the Firecamp extension, you can execute requests from the browser's extension. This helps you avoid CORS issues and provides a seamless experience.

Each Firecamp Agent type offers unique benefits and considerations, allowing you to choose the most suitable environment for your API testing and development needs.


### Agent Comparison

The below table provides an overview of the different Firecamp Agents, including the execution environment and any associated limitations. It can serve as a quick reference for understanding the characteristics of each agent type.

| Agent                  | Request Execution                          | Limitation                          | Solution                                              |
|:---                    |:---                                        |:---                                 |:---                                                   |
| **Browser**            | from Browser environment                   | May encounter CORS errors           | 1. allow https://firecamp.dev domain in your CORS policy or <br/> 2. use [CORS Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino) to bypass CORS. **please read below note on CORS** |
| **Cloud**              | from Firecamp's secure cloud               | Cannot connect to localhost servers | use browser or extension agent for localhost server   |
| **Browse Extension**   | from Browser's extension environment       | Need to install extension           | works fine with browser extension                     |

    Note: 
    Firecamp is actively working on developing a Chrome Extension Agent that will address CORS and other browser limitations to provide a seamless testing experience directly within the Firecamp platform. This agent will help you overcome the CORS restrictions that may occur while making API requests.

    In the meantime, if you encounter CORS-related issues, we recommend using third-party Chrome extensions like [**CORS Unblock**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino). These extensions can temporarily bypass CORS restrictions in your browser, allowing you to test your APIs without being hindered by CORS errors.

    Please note that third-party extensions are developed and maintained by external providers. Exercise caution when installing and using any extension, and ensure that it aligns with your security and privacy requirements.

    [Stay tuned for updates on the release of the Firecamp Chrome Extension Agent](https://discord.com/invite/8hRaqhK), which will provide a native solution for handling CORS and other browser limitations, enhancing your API testing experience within Firecamp.
