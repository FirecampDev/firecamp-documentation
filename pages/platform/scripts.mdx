# Scripts

### Introduction
The scripts feature allows you to write a javascript code to perform certain tasks **before and after** the request execution, also It allows you to write the **test cases** for various API requests.

### Shared script (reusability)
The script can be written at multiple scopes (like request scope, folder scope and collection scope).

#### **Request Scope** 
    - The script written at the request scope will be applicable for that specific request only.
#### **Folder Scope**
    - The script written at the folder scope will be applicable for all the child requests of that specific folder. 
    - In a case where a piece of script is common for all requests within the **folder** then you can write that script at **folder scope** instead of writing for every request.
#### **Collection Scope** 
    - The script written at the collection scope will be applicable for all the child requests of that specific collection
    - In a case where a piece of script is common for all requests within the **collection** then you can write that script at **collection scope** instead of writing for every request.
