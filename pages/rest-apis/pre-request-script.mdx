# Pre-Request Script
The pre-request script is a javascript script that will get executed just before the request run. You can write javascript to perform certain operations which are needed to be completed before request execution start.

### Manage variables 
For example you can manage variables in pre-request script
```ts
//sample pre-request script to set the global variable just before request run
const count = fc.globals.get("increment");
fc.globals.set("increment", increment++);
```

### Shared pre-request script (reusability)
The pre-request script can be written at multiple scopes (like request scope, folder scope and collection scope).

1. **Request Scope** - The script written at the request scope will be applicable for that specific request only.
2. **Folder Scope** - The script written at the folder scope will be applicable for all the child requests of that specific folder. 
    - In a case where a piece of script is common for all requests within the **folder** then you can write that script at **folder scope** instead of writing for every request.
3. **Collection Scope** - The script written at the collection scope will be applicable for all the child requests of that specific collection
    - In a case where a piece of script is common for all requests within the **collection** then you can write that script at **collection scope** instead of writing for every request.
