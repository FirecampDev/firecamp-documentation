## GraphQL Query Explorer and Builder

The GraphQL Query Explorer in Firecamp allow you to create GraphQL operations effortlessly. By leveraging the introspection schema of your API, this feature provides a visual interface where you can click on nodes and fields to build GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions quickly. It eliminates the need for manual query syntax writing and offers a streamlined and efficient way to construct GraphQL operations.

<Callout type="warning">
To enable the visual query builder, ensure that your GraphQL service is exposing the introspection schema, which is required for Firecamp to retrieve the necessary information about your API's types and fields.
