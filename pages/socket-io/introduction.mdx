## SocketIO Playground
The SocketIO Playground in Firecamp offers a comprehensive environment for testing and interacting with Socket.IO-based applications. It provides a range of key features that enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers using the Socket.IO protocol, Firecamp will be the front-end for your backend.

### Key Features
#### 1. Real-time Communication
The SocketIO Playground facilitates seamless real-time communication between clients (here playground) and servers. It leverages the ability of the Socket.IO framework to establish reliable connection for efficient data exchange.

#### 2. Emitters
With the SocketIO Playground, you can send events (emitters) from the client (playground) to the server using the provided connection. This allows you to simulate client actions and send data in real-time.

#### 3. Listeners
The SocketIO Playground enables you to listen for events (listeners) from the server and handle them accordingly. You can define custom event listeners to respond to specific events and perform desired actions on the client-side.

#### 4. Multiple SocketIO Versions
The SocketIO Playground supports multiple versions of the Socket.IO (V2, V3 and V4), ensuring compatibility with various Socket.IO server implementations. You can select the appropriate version to match your server configuration.

#### 5. Multi-transport Support
Socket.IO supports multiple transport options, including WebSocket and polling. The SocketIO Playground seamlessly handles the negotiation and selection of the most suitable transport based on the client's capabilities and server configuration.

#### 6. Event logs
The SocketIO Playground provides event logs that capture the details of the Socket.IO events and interactions. These logs allow you to monitor the communication flow, track event exchanges, and debug any potential issues.
