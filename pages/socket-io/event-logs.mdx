## Understanding Event Logs
The Event Logs section in the SocketIO Playground provides a comprehensive view of all SocketIO events exchanged between the client and the server, including important system events. It captures the events sent to and received from the server, allowing you to monitor the communication flow and troubleshoot any potential issues.

**Logs will include the following information**

#### SocketIO Events
The Event Logs capture all SocketIO events sent to and received from the server, providing a detailed record of the communication between the client and the server. such as **emitter sent/received events**, **listeners** and **acknowledgement events**.

#### System Events
The Event Logs also display important system events, such as **connection success**, **connection failure**, **error messages** and **listener on/off notifications**. These system events provide valuable insights into the overall functioning and status of the SocketIO Playground.

#### Timestamps
Each event in the Event Logs is accompanied by a timestamp, enabling you to track the timing and sequence of events during the communication process.


By monitoring the Event Logs, you can stay informed about the status of the connection, identify errors or failures, and ensure the smooth operation of your Socket.IO-based applications. The inclusion of system events enhances your ability to diagnose and resolve any issues that may arise during communication.
