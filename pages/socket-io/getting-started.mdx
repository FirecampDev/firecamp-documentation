## Getting Started with SocketIO Playground
This guide will walk you through the steps to quickly get started with the SocketIO Playground in Firecamp.

<Steps>
### Enter the Endpoint and Choose SocketIO Version
Start by entering the Socket.IO endpoint URL in the designated field. Additionally, select the desired Socket.IO version to ensure compatibility with your server implementation.

### Establish the Connection
Click on the "Connect" button to establish the connection between the client and the Socket.IO server. The Playground will handle the necessary handshaking and negotiation.

### View Event Logs
Take a look at the Event Logs to monitor the communication between the client and server. The logs will display the details of the events exchanged during the connection.

### Add a Listener
To receive events from the server, add a listener in the Playground. Define the event name and specify the action or response you want to perform when the event occurs.

### Prepare and Emit Events
Prepare the event name and payload in the Emitter section. Enter the event details and click on the "Emit" button to send the event to the server.

### Observe the Event Logs
Check the Event Logs to observe the exchanged events. You will see the events sent by the client as well as any events received from the server.

### Receive Server Events
As the server sends events, you will see them in the Event Logs. The Playground captures and displays the incoming events for you to observe and handle accordingly.

### Close the Connection
To end the Socket.IO connection, click on the "Disconnect" button. This will gracefully close the connection between the client and the server.
